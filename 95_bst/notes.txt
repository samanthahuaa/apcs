HW95 -- Algorithm as Data Structure (Codifying a tree)

time spent: 1hr.

DISCO:
 * The first inserted value is the root of the tree.
 * It's easier to print the pre-order traversal.

QCC:
 * Why do in-order and post-order have to run the recursive method separately for
 the left and right branches of the root? We think this has something to do with the
 way both of those traversals go from the bottom to the top whereas pre-order goes
 from the top to the bottom.
 * Our code has a prerequisite where all new values inputted into the tree are not
 equal to a value already on the tree.
 * We never used the overloaded constructor for TreeNode. Could that have helped
 us somewhere else?

1. A perfect binary tree has 2^(D+1) - 1 nodes.
2. At each level, a perfect binary tree has 2^d (d represents the depth of the level) nodes.
3. Height of a complete binary tree w/ n nodes is h which equals log2(n).
