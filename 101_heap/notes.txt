HW101 -- Heap o'Trouble
2022-05-17
time spent: .5hr

DISCO:
 * Within the tree we have to have a rule about the difference between the left
 and right branches. it makes removing easier and it also makes the tree more
 efficient because it minimizes the tree height which helps with the searching
 * Heaps are more efficient for inserting and sorting compared to sorted array
 lists

QCC:
 * hypothetically, there would be very few differences between the maxheap and
 the minheap
