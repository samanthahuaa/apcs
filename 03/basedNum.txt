Binary to Decimal

1. Write down powers of 2 increasing by 1 under each digit starting with 2^0 on the right and going to the left until the last digit of the binary.
2. Starting at 2^0 write increasing powers of 2 by 1 until you reach 2^n where n is the highest power of 2 (from left to right).
3. For digits in the binary that are ones determine the value of the corresponding power of 2 and add them all up. Note: 0s in binary have no value
4. The sum is the decimal that is equivalent to the binary.

Decimal to Binary

1. Find the highest power of 2 that is lower than the decimal.
2. Evaluate what that value is and subtract that from the decimal. Put a 1 on top of that power of 2.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the decimal reaches 0 and put in 0s for the empty slots
