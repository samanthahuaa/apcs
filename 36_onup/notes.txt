There are 3 types of errors:
  1. Compile-time errors -- syntax error
  2. Run-time errors -- error while running the program
  3. Logic errors - code doesn't do what you want

1:
 - Look for the placement of where the error occurred. Error might be there or it might not be.
 - Debugging by bisection - cut the code in half to see where the error is. Keep cutting the error-causing section in half
   until you find a more specific location of the errors

2:
 - Use print statements to check your code
    - variable values in/out of loops
    - when you enter/exit a loop
    - boolean statements in your loops
 - Don't overdo it to the point where you're confused with the print statements. Comment out things as needed

3:
 - Trace your code and see where your ideas + reality don't align
 - Check that the things from the Java library really do what you think they're doing. Check documentation for that code
 - Break your code down into smaller, easier to understand pieces of code
 - Make sure you call the right file
 - Explain your code and logic to your ducky
 - Ask another person for help
