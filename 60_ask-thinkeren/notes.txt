HW60: A Termite is-a Turtle, a Thinker is-a Turtle
2022-02-07
time spent: 0.4 hrs

Observables:
 * Some turtles were confused on their job. This was impacted by the way other
   turtles were misinforming other turtles. --> Create simple and easy to follow
   tasks
 * Many turtles were needed to properly execute the algorithm
 * Some turtles forgot who had given them their cards which broke the algorithm

DISCO:
 * The instructions have to be simple and straight forward or turtles will get
 confused
 * The algo is only as strong as the weakest link. It only takes one turtle
 who doesn't understand their job to mess up the whole process

QCC:
 * Is there a java equivalent for turtles in NetLogo?
 * Does the fact that more turtles are being used decrease efficiency? (More
 memory is needed)

THINKER FIRMWARE:
 * If you have one card, hand it back to the turtle who gave it to you
 * If you have given and received two piles of cards, sort them.
 * Sort cards using the specified algorithm where you continue to check the top
 cards of both piles and compare them.
 * Once sorted, give the cards back to the turtle who gave those cards to you.
