HW99 -- Some Are More Equal Than Others, Codified (Priority Queue)
2022-05-16
time spent: 1hr. (including class time)

DISCO:
 * peekMin() just finds the smallest int in the Priority Queue with a foreach
 loop
 * we use endIndexOfPriority to separate the priority portion of the queue from
 the non-prioritized part, and it marks the last index of the priority portion,
 so that it is easier to add to the priority part of the queue while still maintaining
 order within that.

QCC:
 * We had a conversation with Team Pom Pom on Friday about the way they were
 keeping track of the priority values. They responded with an explanation about
 how each of their values has a priority value and that there wasn't a binary
 category of priority or not. We had interpreted the priorities to be a set of
 values completing a particular requirement. This shaped the way we structured
 our ArrayList (we put the priority values in the beginning and had an inst var to
 keep track of the barrier between priority and non-priority). We're not sure if
 this is the right interpretation of the class design.
 * Is there a more efficient way to execute peekMin() if we changed the structure
 of our class?
