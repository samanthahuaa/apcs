discos
- T is the convention for a input type we do not know. (T stands for type)
- T can be referenced as an input type even though we don't know what it is
- T does not get set to a value because it is not a variable, it is an input type

QCC:
-If we can generalize why would we want to specify an input type for a method?
-What are some of the benefits for specifying an input type?
-How do we determine which is better in each scenario?
