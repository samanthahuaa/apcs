HW 90 -- our implementation of deque

2022-04-13

time spent: 0.7hrs

**prioritized to-do list:**

IMPLEMENTED:
1. int size() - easy to write
2. boolean isEmpty() - easy to write
3. ORANGE getFirst() - easy to write + crucial
4. ORANGE getLast() - easy to write + crucial
5. void addFirst(ORANGE o) - crucial + easy to write when utilizing pass-thru functionality
6. void addLast(ORANGE o) - crucial + easy to write when utilizing pass-thru functionality
7. ORANGE removeFirst() - crucial
8. ORANGE removeLast() - crucial
9. boolean contains(ORANGE o) - nice to have but not necessary for basic operations

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED:
1. void clear() - seems useful for resetting the deque
2. Object[]	toArray() - seems useful for implementation of deque in a broader context

DESIGN CHOICES:
 - We chose to implement Deque using LinkedList because we thought it would be
 easiest. This decision was also based on time complexity. As noted in class, for
 ArrayList, for enqueue or dequeue to be constant time, a lot of memory is required.
