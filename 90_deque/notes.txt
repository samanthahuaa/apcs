HW91: Deque the Halls
2022-04-13
time spent: 0.8hrs

DISCO:
 - Initially, our clear() algo was O(n) because we had a for loop going through
 the entire Deque and removed an element one by one. However, we realized we could
 improve the effeciency of the method by simply pointing _deque to a new LinkedList

QCC:
 - We originally tried to write a toArray() method before realizing it wasn't really
 a part of the Deque fxnality. However, we encounter error regarding our generalization
 of an array (ex: ORANGE[]). Our error message was "error: generic array creation." What
 does this mean and why can't we generalize arrays?

HW 90 -- our implementation of deque
2022-04-12
time spent: 0.7hrs

DISCO:
 - We implemented this like a wrapper class and used a lot of the functionality
 provided by LinkedList
 - Having a plan is very important. Without it we would be lost ducklings.

QCC:
 - When would it be preferable to use ArrayList instead of LinkedList?
 - Would we ever need to have some sort of capacity limit for a deque? (We implemented it without capacity)
