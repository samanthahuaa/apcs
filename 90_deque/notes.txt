HW 90 -- our implementation of deque
2022-04-13
time spent: 0.7hrs

DISCO:
 - We implemented this like a wrapper class and used a lot of the functionality
 provided by LinkedList
 - Having a plan is very important. Without it we would be lost ducklings.

QCC:
 - When would it be preferable to use ArrayList instead of LinkedList?
 - Would we ever need to have some sort of capacity limit for a deque? (We implemented it without capacity)
