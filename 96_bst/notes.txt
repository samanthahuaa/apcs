HW95 -- Algorithm as Data Structure (Codifying a tree)

time spent: 1hr.

DISCO:
 * The height of the tree can be found by finding the heights of the min and max
 value and comparing them to find the greater one. This is because we know the
 structure of the tree will always have the min value the furthest on the left and
 the max value the furthest on the right. One of the two values will always be
 the height of the whole tree 
 * A helper method that is recursive helps tremendously

 * The first inserted value is the root of the tree.
 * It's easier to print the pre-order traversal.

QCC:
 * We were not able to finish the numLeaves method because we could not find
 a way to get it to sum up all the total number of leaves. Our algo relied on
 going down the tree recursively so that we could reach the nodes where there are
 no left or right pointers and add 1 to a sum.
 * Were helper methods needed for search and height?
--
5/9
 * Why do in-order and post-order have to run the recursive method separately for
 the left and right branches of the root? We think this has something to do with the
 way both of those traversals go from the bottom to the top whereas pre-order goes
 from the top to the bottom.
 * Our code has a prerequisite where all new values inputted into the tree are not
 equal to a value already on the tree.
 * We never used the overloaded constructor for TreeNode. Could that have helped
 us somewhere else?

1. A perfect binary tree has 2^(D+1) - 1 nodes.
2. At each level, a perfect binary tree has 2^d (d represents the depth of the level) nodes.
3. Height of a complete binary tree w/ n nodes is h which equals log2(n).
