The lab took an awful lot of time, and there was a lot of reading, something that we all agree would definitely impede us during the APexam. Throughout the course of the lab, we learned a couple of new things, as noted throughout our notes file. We liked the way the differentactivities built upon one another. We had an issue with Activities 5 and 6, but those were universal, and resolved. We worked on Activity 9but our code wasn't saved - thankfully, the solution existed in the following activity. Overall, there was a lot of work in this lab, but itwas intriguing to go through the different card games. This was also our first experience with visuals in Java, so that was pretty fun too!
