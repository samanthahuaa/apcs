L09: Some Folks Call It A Charades
2022-04-27
time spent: 6hrs.

DISCO:
  - Listeners in Java reminded me of listeners in JS as they can be used to track
  user interaction in the GUI
  - Having repeatable code makes it easy to expand your program. (ex: Literature was similar
  to Movie)
  - [related to the disco above] breaking down a program into smaller, repeatable
  parts makes it easier to code and understand when reading it over
  - .equalsIgnoreCase is utilized when you don't care about upper/lower case between the two
  things you are comparing

QCC:
  - celebrityRadio.addActionListener(select -> clueLabel.setText(celebrityClue));
      In the above line of code a "->" is used. What does it do and how was it used here?
  - We're not really sure about how the timer was implemented
  - We did not have time to complete Activity 5
