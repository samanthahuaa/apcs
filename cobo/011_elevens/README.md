**L07: But These Go Up To Eleven**

**2022-03-20**

**time spent: 5 hrs.**

The lab took a long time but we learned a couple of new things as noted in the
DISCO portion of our notes file. We liked the way the different activities built
upon one another. We had trouble with Activity5 and brought the issue to Piazza.
Overall, there was a lot of work in this lab but it was mostly reading and
answering questions.
