time spent:

1. a. sentimentVal( String word )
   b. Yes, the parameter is a String. If you pass in a parameter that is not a
   String, you will recieve an error about incompatible types.
   c. The method returns a double.

2. I tested the words "hot", "acceptable", and "terrible" which returned the
values -0.33, -0.12, and -3.38, respectively.

3. a. I think this would compile because sentimentVal() returns a double which
is saved in the variable with a var type of double.
   b. This would not compile because the variable word has a var type of String
   which is incompatible with doubles
   c. This would not compile because sentimentVal() only has one parameter but 
   this line of code tries to send in two.
