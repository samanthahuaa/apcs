time spent:

1. a. sentimentVal( String word )
   b. Yes, the parameter is a String. If you pass in a parameter that is not a
   String, you will recieve an error about incompatible types.
   c. The method returns a double.

2. I tested the words "hot", "acceptable", and "terrible" which returned the
values -0.33, -0.12, and -3.38, respectively.

3. a. I think this would compile because sentimentVal() returns a double which
is saved in the variable with a var type of double.
   b. This would not compile because the variable word has a var type of String
   which is incompatible with doubles
   c. This would not compile because sentimentVal() only has one parameter but
   this line of code tries to send in two.

4. a. The way totalSentiment works is by turning the input file into a String
and iterating through the string to remove any punctutation. It then looks at
each character within the string to determine if it is white space. If it is, it
counts the sentimental value of the word that preceded the white space. This
value is counted up using a counter which is returned.
