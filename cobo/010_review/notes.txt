==ACTIVITY 1==
1. a. sentimentVal( String word )
   b. Yes, the parameter is a String. If you pass in a parameter that is not a
   String, you will receive an error about incompatible types.
   c. The method returns a double.

2. I tested the words "hot", "acceptable", and "terrible" which returned the
values -0.33, -0.12, and -3.38, respectively.

3. a. I think this would compile because sentimentVal() returns a double which
is saved in the variable with a var type of double.
   b. This would not compile because the variable word has a var type of String
   which is incompatible with doubles
   c. This would not compile because sentimentVal() only has one parameter but
   this line of code tries to send in two.

4. The way totalSentiment works is by turning the input file into a String
and iterating through the string to remove any punctuation. It then looks at
each character within the string to determine if it is white space. If it is, it
counts the sentimental value of the word that preceded the white space. This
value is counted up using a counter which is returned.

5. a. The ratings kind of make sense because they are based on the associated
sentimentVal with the words used in the review but the length of the review also
impacts the rating.
   b. We could change the algorithm so that the totalSentiment value is by
   FINISHHHHHHHH. Another way to change totalSentiment is
   by forcing it to take the average of the sentiment value of the whole String.

6. a. The error is that all of the boolean statements after totalSentiment < 15
are included within the first boolean statement. Therefore, the code will never
get past the first boolean statement and return 4 every time.
   b. If the order of the boolean statements were reversed, this logical error
   would be avoided.

==ACTIVITY 3==
3. indexOf returns the specific index of a particular character within a String.
For example, in the String "hello," indexOf('h') would return 0. substring
returns a part of a String. For example, substring(0,3) of "hello" would return
"he." You must add 1 to the position of the space when copying the remainder of
the String because substring(a,b) is inclusive of a but exclusive of b. Without
adding 1, the remainder of the String would include the space at the first index.
