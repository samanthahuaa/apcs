errata:

* hashmap is java equivalent to the python dictionaries you know and love
* nothing else should seem too unfamiliar to a Thinker

DISCO
------------------------------------------------
* We discovered that charAt could be used to look at the first letter of a
given String.
* We realized that when comparing Characters, we do not need to use .equals. We
can utilize ==. The implications of this are that Characters are stored in the
same memory location.
================================================

QCC
------------------------------------------------
* Is there a faster way to remove certain letters from Strings? We used another
String to slowly add to but feel like there could be a solution that is more
efficient.
* We found that certain adjectives didn't make sense in the context they were
used in. (ex: The restaurant was savory) How can we ensure that the adjective
used is always used correctly?
